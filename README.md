# Data Viz with Python and JavaScript

Git Repo for experimenting with web scraping, data munging, and data vizualization. It's still a bit of a mess as I'm in an exploratory phase, but I expect it to start coming together in a more cohesive way in a few days.

### Activate Virtual Environment

`$ source activate pyjsviz`

### Start HTTP Server

`$ python3 -m http.server`
